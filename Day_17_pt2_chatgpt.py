def backward_solve(program):
    """
    Backward solve for A given the program. We know that:
    - The program loops until A=0.
    - Each iteration outputs one element of the program in order.
    - We want the minimal positive A that achieves this.

    We'll need to re-derive the iteration logic by simulating the instructions
    to find a closed form for the output. However, given the complexity, we will:
    - Guess that the program forms a loop controlled by jnz at the end.
    - The output is produced once per loop iteration by the 'out' instruction(s).
    
    Here, we take a more direct approach:
    We know the final output sequence is exactly the program.
    We know that after the last output, A=0.

    We'll run the loop logic backwards by simulating the instructions that transform A,B,C each iteration.
    But since the instructions are complicated, we do a step-by-step backward deduction using a search over possible last digits of A at each step.

    Steps:
    - Identify the loop structure: The program likely ends with 'jnz ...' instruction that jumps back to 0.
    - Confirm that each iteration outputs exactly one value (as stated in the puzzle).
    - We'll reconstruct A from the outputs by a backward search.

    We'll implement a custom backward iteration approach tailored to the given program:
    [2,4,1,7,7,5,1,7,0,3,4,1,5,5,3,0]
    
    From the analysis, each iteration does:
    A_i (start of iteration i)
    IP=0: bst B = A_i%8
    IP=2: bxl B = B^7
    IP=4: cdv C = A_i // (2^(B)) with B=(A_i%8)^7
    IP=6: bxl B = B^7 again, restoring B = A_i%8
    IP=8: adv A = A_i//8  => A_{i+1} = A_i//8
    IP=10:bxc B = B^C = (A_i%8)^C
    IP=12:out output=(B%8)=((A_i%8)^C)%8
    IP=14:jnz if A!=0 goto 0 else halt

    Where C = A_i // (2^( (A_i%8)^7 )) from IP=4 step.

    Let's define a function that, given A_i and produces output_i:
    output_i = ((A_i%8) ^ (A_i//(2^(7-(A_i%8))))) % 8
    Because (A_i%8)^7 = 7-(A_i%8) (XOR with 7 flips bits 0-7 into 7-x)
    and so 2^(B) = 2^( (A_i%8)^7 ) = 2^(7-(A_i%8)).

    We'll verify that logic by direct implementation here and then solve backward.
